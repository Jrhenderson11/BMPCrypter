# BMPCrypter
A project I made to teach myself a bit of C and practise using encryption. Uses a BMP image (hashed using my own implemented SHA256) as an encryption key for AES


Can't say I put this together very proffesionally

library was added in really badly, basically just dumped the files in a folder on my desktop and linked them.
